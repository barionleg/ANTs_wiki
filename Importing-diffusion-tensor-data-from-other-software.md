Information on importing diffusion tensors will be here.

## Structure of diffusion tensor data

## Image and tensor coordinate system

## NIFTI and other file formats

Tensors in other file formats supported by ITK (such as MetaIO or NRRD) may also work, if you have example code to include below, please let us know.


## Examples

Below are some examples of how to fit diffusion tensors in the correct NIFTI format for ANTs, using some common diffusion software packages.
