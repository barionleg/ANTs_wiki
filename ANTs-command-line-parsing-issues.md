This page lists some known issues with ANTs command line parsing. 


## Shell expansion of square brackets



## File names containing multiple extensions

This should not be a problem any longer but may affect older versions. Multiple extensions, or even just periods, in file names used to cause errors. Some known issues have been fixed (for example [568](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs/pull/568) and [658](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs/pull/658)).
